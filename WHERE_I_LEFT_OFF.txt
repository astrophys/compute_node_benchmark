Did:
   

To Do:
2. Install modern gcc like 7.0 or 8.0
3. Figure out how to handle arbitrary number of cores in a machine for testing
4. Add error checks matrix_multiply_omp_cache_optimized.c for CL args
5. Check that AB_result.txt from numpy is same as from matrix_multiply
7. Test lapack
8. Add License
11. Build data in /tmp b/c this is a bind point in Singularity
12. simulate_fastq : 
    a) Randomly sample quality space from probability distribution function
    b) Add switch for single end vs. paired end reads (include --fr, --rf and unstranded). In
       FASTQ_READ()
       --> See functions.py : 924
       --> See : http://onetipperday.sterding.com/2012/07/how-to-tell-which-library-type-to-use.html
    c) Add CL or config variable for mu and sigma for insert length
13. Add file access time on /dev/shm
14. Tried running :
    tophat2 -p 4 /reference/homo_sapiens/GRCh38/ensembl/release-83/Sequence/Bowtie2Index/Homo_sapiens.GRC38 poop.fq
    --> Not effective for debugging.
15. Check that my reads are correctly mapping to the transcripts: 
    Single exons : 
16. Fix number of reads at CL vs. config.txt
17. Check that I handle direction correctly (+/-) in ensembl's gtf format correctly
18. Change nomenclature from forward/reverse sense/antisense strand

19. Figure out how to pass shell variables in singularity during build time
20. Create config files for Baker, Singularity and OSX that points to the correct
    dirs to use. This will eliminate the non-portable hassel of changing pathnames
