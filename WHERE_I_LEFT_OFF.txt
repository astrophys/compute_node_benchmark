Did:

To Do:
1. Install modern gcc like 7.0 or 8.0
2. Add error checks matrix_multiply_omp_cache_optimized.c for CL args
3. Check that AB_result.txt from numpy is same as from matrix_multiply
4. Test lapack
5. simulate_fastq : 
    a) Randomly sample quality space from probability distribution function
    b) Add switch for single end vs. paired end reads (include --fr, --rf and unstranded). In
       FASTQ_READ()
       --> See functions.py : 924
       --> See : http://onetipperday.sterding.com/2012/07/how-to-tell-which-library-type-to-use.html
    c) Add CL or config variable for mu and sigma for insert length
6. Check that my reads are correctly mapping to the transcripts: 
    Single exons : 
7. Fix number of reads at CL vs. config.txt - currently both look set, only CL
   option used
8. Check that I handle direction correctly (+/-) in ensembl's gtf format correctly
9. Change nomenclature from forward/reverse sense/antisense strand

10. Figure out how to pass shell variables in singularity during build time
11. Test singularity build when ref is unavailable.
12. Don't forget to uncomment matrix multiplication routines in recipe file.
13. Check that taskset is in fact actually doing what I think it should. 
    --> see top -> 'press 1'
14. Check that runTimeV and tIdx is correct size in all options
15. Check that cuffnorm outputs reasonable results. 
16. Add note to kelvin (once committed) noting that it is not for general consumption.
17. Add stringtie and ballgown (if I have time).
18. Fix simulate_fastq to not use seeded random numbers.
19. Create larger dataset for hisat.
20. remove --nv from run command
