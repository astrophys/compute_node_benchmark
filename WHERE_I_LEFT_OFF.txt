Did:
1. Added taskset calls to cmd in driver.py

To Do:
2. Install modern gcc like 7.0 or 8.0
3. Figure out how to handle arbitrary number of cores in a machine for testing
4. Add error checks matrix_multiply_omp_cache_optimized.c for CL args
5. Check that AB_result.txt from numpy is same as from matrix_multiply
7. Test lapack
8. Add License
12. simulate_fastq : 
    a) Randomly sample quality space from probability distribution function
    b) Add switch for single end vs. paired end reads (include --fr, --rf and unstranded). In
       FASTQ_READ()
       --> See functions.py : 924
       --> See : http://onetipperday.sterding.com/2012/07/how-to-tell-which-library-type-to-use.html
    c) Add CL or config variable for mu and sigma for insert length
13. Add file access time on /dev/shm
15. Check that my reads are correctly mapping to the transcripts: 
    Single exons : 
16. Fix number of reads at CL vs. config.txt
17. Check that I handle direction correctly (+/-) in ensembl's gtf format correctly
18. Change nomenclature from forward/reverse sense/antisense strand

19. Figure out how to pass shell variables in singularity during build time
21. Consider adding nTrials to cuffmerge.
22. Add ability to select number of threads based on cores per socket and total number of threads in driver.py
23. Add notes about correct usage of workPath and refPath to README.md
24. Change matrixSizeL to larger values.
25. Make note about stream license
26. Test singularity build when ref is unavailable.
27. Fix kelvin option so it can be run from the toplevel directory.
28. Don't forget to uncomment matrix multiplication routines in recipe file.
29. Check that taskset is in fact actually doing what I think it should. 
    --> see top -> 'press 1'
30. Plot columns 1:2 from stream output, see how it goes
31. Check that runTimeV and tIdx is correct size in all options
33. Check that cuffnorm outputs reasonable results. 
34. Add note to kelvin (once committed) noting that it is not for general consumption.
35. Add stringtie and ballgown (if I have time).
36. Fix simulate_fastq to not use seeded random numbers.
37. Create larger dataset for hisat.
